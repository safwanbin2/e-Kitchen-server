        "description": "History credits the Turks with kebabs, a cooking style devised by soldiers in the field who skewered meat on their swords to cook it over open flames. Shish kebab translates and encompasses many versions of the popular and now widespread Middle Eastern dish. Kebabs slowly spread across the Western food culture scene after World War II, becoming ubiquitous in the U.S. over the past few decades.Kebabs originated with roughly torn chunks of lamb, but worldly variations use cubed, ground, and sliced marinated meats and often pair the protein with vegetables. Just about every Middle Eastern country claims a signature version of kebab, resulting in multiple spellings, including kabob, kebob, kebap, and kabab. There are many other versions of meat grilled on a stick, such as Japanese yakitori, Southeast Asian satay, and Greek souvlaki.",
